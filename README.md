- - -
A helper to easily switch a git repositories remotes from `ssh` to `https` and
back. Useful for places where `ssh` is blocked (such as some mermaid
coffee-shops in SÃ£o Paulo, as of recently). URLs starting with `git://` are also
supported.

## Usage
```bash
$ git-switch-protocol -p https
Switching all remotes to `https`...
  > git remote -v
Switching remote `origin` from `ssh` to `https`...
  > git remote set-url origin https://github.com/yamadapc/pyjamas.git
Remote `bitbucket` is already using `https`. Skipping...
```
